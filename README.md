# djangowallet

This is a Django REST API example with wallets as a model. I have created a wallet app inside the djangowallet/ project.

This wallet app has a model called wallet. (Go to models.py file)

This model has a field called "rddresss" (Walet is the class name for models.py)

I have defined CRUD functions inside views.py (default)

I am also using serializers, refer to serializers.py file (Targets our Wallet model, which is model.py file and all of the fields inside it)
